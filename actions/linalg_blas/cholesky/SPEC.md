# `cholesky`

Computes the Cholesky factorization of a symmetric positive-definite 2D matrix ($A = L L^T$).

## Interface
- **Input Type**: `DataType::Tensor` (`Payload::Tensor`)
- **Output Type**: `DataType::Tensor` (`Payload::Tensor`)
- **Supported DTypes**: F32 computation and output; other numerical inputs are converted to F32

## Parameters
None.

## Behavior
- Computes lower triangular matrix $L$ such that $L L^T = A$.

## OpenBLAS backend
This action belongs to `linalg_blas/0.1.2`. It uses the host's shared LP64 OpenBLAS library during execution. OpenBLAS is not bundled in the action binary. Shapechecking and pipeline loading do not load OpenBLAS. Set `MORFLOW_OPENBLAS_LIBRARY` to select an explicit shared library path. There is no fallback to the basics implementation if the library is missing.

## Runtime plugin

Declare `plugin openblas/0.1.1` in the pipeline and run `morflow prep`. These actions require the `openblas` plugin with a compatible `^0.1.0` version. The plugin loads shared system OpenBLAS during execution; shape checking remains offline. See `plugins/openblas/README.md` for system requirements.
